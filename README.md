## Overview

What are rule Engines?

* Define a set of actions based on specific conditions
* Conditions should be configurable at runtime
* Prevent coupling code to used cases
* Requirements can or will change
* Consolidate business logic

Components:

* Rule Engines will check input against one or more Rules
* Rules are a policy with Triggers, Conditions and Effects
* Triggers determine if a rule should be performed
* Conditions perform checks that pass or fail
* Effects are outcomes when conditions met
